Priorities
==========
   * Clean out old unused files - scons build system is dead, cmake is the way to go.
   * GTK GUI was not cross-platform. A Qt5 version of the GUI has been created to meet this need. 
     The GTK GUI has been retired and is no longer supported.
   * The Qt GUI has by far exceeded the capabilities of the older GTK version. Below is a GUI capability 
     matrix showing the differences between the two. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THE Qt GUI.
   * Code cleanup. Lots of compiler warnings with newer GCC. Maybe I'm OCD... but these warnings bother me.

Features
========
   * Emulator no runs as a separate thread from the GUI. Much improved performance.
   * Cross platform QT GUI is fully functional

	* GUI Debug Tools Pretty Much Done
   * GUI now compiles in windows as well.

BUGS
